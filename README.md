# demo-deleter
Simple plugin that just deletes all demo files in the /tf directory on start

## Important Notes
This plugin is intended for use on TF2 servers

If you have this running on a server used for competitive, be sure to save official match demos in a different location than /tf. 

Orgs like RGL prefer you keep server-side demos for the duration of the season, PLUS a few months to allow for anti-cheat personel to complete any extra reviews.
